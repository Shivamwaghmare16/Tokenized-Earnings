### Future Improvements
Here are **short and concise future improvements** for the `TokenizedEarnings` contract:  

1. **Add Metadata Support:**
   - Include `description` and `metadataURI` fields in the `Product` struct for detailed product info.  

2. **Dynamic Token Supply:**
   - Implement variable token minting rates based on demand or external oracles.  

3. **Automated Revenue Distribution:**
   - Automate splitting and allocation of revenue to product creators and stakeholders.  

4. **ERC-20 Compatibility:**
   - Extend functionality to meet the ERC-20 standard for better interoperability.  

5. **Role-Based Permissions:**
   - Introduce granular roles using OpenZeppelin’s `AccessControl` for better access management.  

6. **Decentralized Approvals:**
   - Replace centralized product approval with a community-driven voting mechanism.  

7. **Analytics Functions:**
   - Create functions to query total revenue or token balances by creator or product.  

8. **Upgradeable Contracts:**
   - Use a proxy pattern (e.g., OpenZeppelin's `Upgradeable`) for easier future updates.  

9. **Fee Mechanism:**
   - Introduce platform fees or gasless approvals for contract sustainability.  

10. **NFT Integration:**
    - Attach NFT-based licenses to products for added value and uniqueness.  

11. **Support for Stablecoins:**
    - Allow payment or revenue in stablecoins like USDC/DAI for reduced volatility.  

12. **Event History Pagination:**
    - Enable users to fetch paginated event logs for better on-chain data retrieval.  

These improvements can significantly enhance the contract’s functionality, usability, and scalability!
